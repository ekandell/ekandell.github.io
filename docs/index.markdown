<font size="4"> I'm a software developer and UC Berkeley graduate with a major in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and minor in <strong>Data Science</strong>. Here you can find my work experience, links to personal and school projects, my resume, and more.</font>
<br>
<font size="4"> When I took my first coding class during my initial semester at Berkeley, I immediately fell in love with both topics covered in the course: Computer Science and Data Science. The rest of my time at Cal was spent taking a whirlwind of classes and being exposed to as many aspects of these fields as possible, even tutoring others in the same intro classes I loved.</font>     
<br>
<font size="4"> Afterward, I moved to Austin, where I have worked for the past year in multiple positions at <strong>Dell Technologies<strong>. I started in a data analytics role, where I became accustomed to the corporate world and grew a lot both personally and professionally. I had the opportunity to learn from several senior data scientists and data engineers, and I gained knowledge I never would've gotten in a classroom. In the new year of 2025, I was fortunate enough to have my role shift to the IT organization, where I began working with a development team in a software engineering position. I have learned so much in a short time, especially being able to work with other developers from around the globe and participating in a fully Agile team. This opportunity has reaffirmed for me that I truly enjoy coding, and that software development is where I want to end up.

<font size="4">I'm now moving back to California and I'm looking for a new position where I can effectively use my skills and knowledge to make a difference for the people and world around me. If you have any questions or want to contact me further, my information is listed below. Hope to hear from you soon!
