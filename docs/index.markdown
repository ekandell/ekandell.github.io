description: Coder. Tutor. Data Scientist. Problem Solver.

<font size="4"> I'm a UC Berkeley student double majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong>. Here you can find links to personal projects, descriptions of school projects, my resume, and more.</font>
<br>
<font size="4"> When I took my first coding class (Introduction to Data Science) two years ago during my initial semester at Berkeley, I immediately fell in love with both topics covered in the course: Computer Science and Data Science. Since then, I've spent all my time at Cal taking a whirlwind of classes and being exposed to as many aspects of these fields as I can find, even tutoring others in the same intro classes I loved. Despite only recently finding my passion for computer science and although I have near-constant coding work for my classes, I've already begun creating personal projects and am planning my contributions to open-source projects in the near future.</font>     
<br>
<font size="4"> Now, entering my second semester of junior year and armed with the strong foundation of knowledge that only Berkeley can offer, I'm working to find an internship where I can use these skills to make a difference while also preparing me for my future career.
