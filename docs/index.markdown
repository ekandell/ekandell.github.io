<font size="4"> I'm a UC Berkeley student majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and minoring in <strong>Data Science</strong>. Here you can find my past experience, links to personal and school projects, my resume, and more.</font>
<br>
<font size="4"> When I took my first coding class (Introduction to Data Science) two years ago during my initial semester at Berkeley, I immediately fell in love with both topics covered in the course: Computer Science and Data Science. Since then, I've spent all my time at Cal taking a whirlwind of classes and being exposed to as many aspects of these fields as I can find, even tutoring others in the same intro classes I loved. Despite only recently finding my passion for computer science and although I have near-constant coding work for my classes, I've already begun creating personal projects and am planning my contributions to open-source projects in the near future.</font>     
<br>
<font size="4"> I just completed a 10-week Data Science internship at **Dell Technologies**, where I learned and grew an extraordinary amount both personally and professionally. I gained skills it's impossible to get from classes alone, such as working with enormous amounts of data and understanding the task of creating production-level code. Now, entering the final year of my undergraduate degree and armed with the strong foundation of knowledge that only Berkeley can offer, I'm looking to find a full-time position once I graduate where I can use these skills to make a difference and jumpstart my career.
