# Welcome, I'm Evan Kandell

<font size="5"> I'm a UC Berkeley student double majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <em>Data Science</em>. Here you can find links to personal projects, descriptions of school projects, my resume, and more.</font>

<font size="5"> When I took my first coding class (also an introduction to Data Science) 2 years ago during my initial semester at Berkeley, I immediately fell in love with both topics. Since then, I've spent all my time at Cal taking a whirlwind of classes and being exposed to as many aspects of the fields as I can find, even tutoring others in the same intro class I loved. Despite only recently finding my passion for computer science and the near-constant coding work for my classes, I've already begun creating personal projects and am planning my contributions to open-source projects in the near future.</font>

<font size="5"> Now, entering my second semester of junior year and armed with the strong foundation of knowledge that only Berkeley can offer, I'm working to find an internship where I can use these skills to contribute and make a difference while also preparing me for my future career path.

<font size="5">If you have any questions or want to contact me further, my information is listed below. Hope to hear from you soon!
