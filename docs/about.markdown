### Input Course List
### Talk about non-cs stuff (frisbee, coops, etc)

<font size="4"> I am a strong student and a fast learner. Additionally, I'm generally a quiet, laid-back person, and that means when presented with a problem I don't rush in right away, but I'm able to look at it from multiple angles and figure out the best path forward. One of the things that appeals to me most about computer science is its puzzle-like qualities, in which taking that extra time to reread the problem and create a design doc can make a difference. It also means I truly get joy from coming up with the solutions, just like I might with a puzzle. </font>
