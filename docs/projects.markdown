- ## Encrypted File Sharing
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo and design doc available upon request 
<br>
##### A project for my cybersecurity class, which was very tough but very rewarding. I build a client to store data in an insecure database utilizing public and private key cryptography, digital signatures, HMACs, Password-based and hash-based key derivation, and more. Although writing the \>1000 lines of Golang was difficult, the design of this project was more so. I'm very proud of this project due to it's complexity both in conceptual understanding and implementation.

- ## RookieDB
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### Over the course of a semester, I built nearly every aspect of a database management system in Java. RookieDB used B+ tree indices, and supported various advancements that are essential to today's database systems. These included query optimization, recovery logging, concurrency. I also learned SQL as I worked on it so as to be able to properly use the software.

- ## Build Your Own World
[Project Spec](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/) \- Github repo available upon request \- [In-depth Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT7JsByTKUo&ab_channel=DhruvVaish)
<br>
##### Collaboratively built an interactive 2D video game with randomly generated worlds. By far the most creative project I've done, where we got to establish aesthetics and design of both the world and code, including underlying data structures and algorithms. Added in extra features to the base spec, such as audio, cheat codes, and more complicated gameplay mechanics.

- ## Hog and Scheme Contests
[Hog Leaderboard](https://hog-contest.cs61a.org/winners) \- [Scheme Submission (Abstract Snail)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp21/proj/scheme_gallery/#abstract-snail)
<br>
##### I got second place in a strategy contest for the hog dice game in a famously difficult, 1000+ person intro CS class. I achieved this using intense recursion and probability to predict what the rest of the game might look like, and basing my choices on that. Additionally, in the same class, I won first place in a graphics contest using the Scheme programming language to create an image.

- ## This site!
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ekandell.github.io)
<br>
##### My first foray into using jekyll and markdown in addition to html and CSS to produce a functioning website.
<br>

- ## Ultimate Frisbee Team Site
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ultimate-team-site)
<br>
##### A site I built using web foundations - html, CSS, and javascript - to advertise my ultimate frisbee team. Although it was never published and needs to be updated with the new roster, it has good fundamentals in addition to some fun javascript additions.

- ## Flashcards
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/flashcards)
<br>
##### A simple swift iOS app I built to replicate tangible flashcards.
<br>

- ## Spotify Stats Web App
Coming Soon!
<br>

- ## NumC
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### I created my own version of the python library Numpy using C. I optimized code for significantly increased performance (up to 500x speedup) using SIMD, OpenMP, loop unrolling, and more efficient algorithms.
<br>

- ## Gitlet
[Project Spec](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### Working with a partner, I created a version-control software in Java based on Git that replicates add, remove, checkout, reset, merge, etc.
