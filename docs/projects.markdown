- ## This site!
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ekandell.github.io)
    > My first foray into using jekyll and markdown to produce a functioning website.

- ## Encrypted File Sharing
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo and design doc available upon request
    A project for my cybersecurity class, which was very tough but very rewarding. I build a client to store data in an insecure database utilizing public and private key cryptography, digital signatures, HMACs, Password-based and hash-based key derivation, and more. Although writing the \>1000 lines of Golang was difficult, the design of this project was more so. I'm very proud of this project due to it's complexity both in conceptual understanding and implementation.

- ## RookieDB
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
    > Over the course of a semester, I built nearly every aspect of a database management system in Java. RookieDB used B+ tree indices, and supported various advancements that are essential to today's database systems. These included query optimization, recovery logging, concurrency. I also learned SQL as I worked on it so as to be able to properly use the software.

- ## Flashcards
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/flashcards)
    > A simple iOS app I built to replicate tangible flashcards.
