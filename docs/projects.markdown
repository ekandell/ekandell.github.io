    > A project for my cybersecurity class, which was very tough but very rewarding. I build a client to store data in an insecure database utilizing public and private key cryptography, digital signatures, HMACs, Password-based and hash-based key derivation, and more. Although the \>1000 lines of code were difficult, the design of this project was the hardest part and took the most time. I'm very proud of this project due to it's complexity both in conceptual understanding and implementation.
