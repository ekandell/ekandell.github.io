- ## This site!
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ekandell.github.io)
    > My first foray into using jekyll and markdown to produce a functioning website.

- ## Encrypted File Sharing
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo and design doc available upon request 
<br>
##### A project for my cybersecurity class, which was very tough but very rewarding. I build a client to store data in an insecure database utilizing public and private key cryptography, digital signatures, HMACs, Password-based and hash-based key derivation, and more. Although writing the \>1000 lines of Golang was difficult, the design of this project was more so. I'm very proud of this project due to it's complexity both in conceptual understanding and implementation.

- ## RookieDB
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
    > Over the course of a semester, I built nearly every aspect of a database management system in Java. RookieDB used B+ tree indices, and supported various advancements that are essential to today's database systems. These included query optimization, recovery logging, concurrency. I also learned SQL as I worked on it so as to be able to properly use the software.

- ## Flashcards
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/flashcards)
    > A simple swift iOS app I built to replicate tangible flashcards.

- ## NumC
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
    > I created my own version of the python library Numpy using C. I optimized code for significantly increased performance (up to 500x speedup) using SIMD, OpenMP, loop unrolling, and more efficient algorithms.

- ## Gitlet
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
    > Working with a partner, I created a version-control software in Java based on Git that replicates add, remove, checkout, reset, merge, etc. 

- ## Build Your Own World
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request \- [In-depth Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT7JsByTKUo&ab_channel=DhruvVaish)
    > Collaboratively built an interactive 2D video game with randomly generated worlds. By far the most creative project I've done, where we got to establish aesthetics and design of both the world and code, including underlying data structures and algorithms. Added in extra features to the base spec, such as audio, cheat codes, and more complicated gameplay mechanics.
