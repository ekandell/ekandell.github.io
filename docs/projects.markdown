- ## Encrypted File Sharing
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo and design doc available upon request 
<br>
##### For a project for my cybersecurity class, which was very tough but very rewarding, I built a client to store confidential data in an insecure database without compromising security. I utilized public and private key cryptography, digital signatures, HMACs, password-based and hash-based key derivation, and more. Although writing the \>1000 lines of Golang was difficult, the design of this project was more so. I'm proud of this project due to its complexity both in conceptual understanding and implementation.

- ## Pacman AI/ML
[Project Spec]([https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/projects/)) \- Github repos available upon request 
<br>
##### In order to learn the building blocks of modern-day artificial intelligence and machine learning, I utilized algorithms/tools such as A* search, logical inference, Q-learning, Hidden Markov Models, Bayes Networks, neural networks, and more to solve a variety of increasingly complex search problems. These projects were all completed in Python, with the Pacman world as a foundation to base the rules of my algorithms and processes on.

- ## RookieDB
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### Over the course of a semester, I built nearly every aspect of a database management system in Java. I implemented B+ tree indices and supported various advancements that are essential to today's database systems. These included query optimization, recovery logging, and concurrency. I also learned SQL as I worked on the project so as to be able to properly use the software.

- ## Build Your Own World
[Project Spec](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/) \- Github repo available upon request \- [In-depth Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT7JsByTKUo&ab_channel=DhruvVaish)
<br>
#####  By far the most creative project I've done, where my partner and I established aesthetics and design of both the world and code, including underlying data structures and algorithms. We collaboratively built an interactive 2D video game with randomly generated worlds. I also added extra features beyond the base spec, such as audio, cheat codes, and more complicated gameplay mechanics.
<br>

- ## Hog and Scheme Contests
[Hog Leaderboard](https://hog-contest.cs61a.org/winners) \- [Scheme Submission (Abstract Snail)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp21/proj/scheme_gallery/#abstract-snail)
<br>
##### I placed second in a strategy contest for the hog dice game in a famously difficult, 1000+ person intro CS class. I achieved this using intense recursion and probability to predict what the rest of the game might look like, and basing my choices on that. Additionally, in the same class, I won first place in a graphics contest using the Scheme programming language to create an image.

- ## Personal Website
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ekandell.github.io)
<br>
##### My first foray into using Jekyll and markdown in addition to HTML and CSS to produce a functioning website where I can display my projects and accomplishments.
<br>

- ## NumC
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### I created my own version of the Python library Numpy using C. I optimized code for significantly increased performance (up to 500x speedup) using SIMD, OpenMP, loop unrolling, and more efficient algorithms.
<br>

- ## Gitlet
[Project Spec](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### Working with a partner, I created a version-control software in Java based on Git that replicates add, remove, checkout, reset, merge, etc. 
<br>

- ## Ultimate Frisbee Team Site
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ultimate-team-site)
<br>
##### A site I built using web foundations - HTML, CSS, and javascript - to advertise my ultimate frisbee team. Although it was never published and needs to be updated with the new roster, it has good fundamentals in addition to some fun javascript additions.
<br>

- ## Flashcards
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/flashcards)
<br>
##### A very simple swift iOS app I built to replicate tangible flashcards.
<br>

- ## Spotify Stats Web App
In production!
