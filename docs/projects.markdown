- ## Flextensions
[Project Github Page](https://github.com/berkeley-cdss/flextensions) 
<br>
##### In this semester-long project, myself and a team of 5 other people embarked on an effort to create a standard and easy system for everyone across the university to request and approve extensions on class assignments. We worked as an Agile team with an instructor mentor to build this greenfield app, and achieved the core functionality we were aiming for. It has since been passed on to future iterations of the class, who are building on what we did to improve the app, make it more user-friendly, etc. This project was done in Ruby on Rails, with a big focus on API design, database schema, and documentation, since we knew we would be passing off the project to others. It also included standard Agile practices, such as frequent standups, customer meetings, pair programming, and assigning/tracking stories. This class and project, more than any other, gave me great insight into what the work of a software engineer might look like and reaffirmed my interest in the field.

- ## NLP Project
[Project Spec](https://ucbnlp24.github.io/webpage/) \- Code and writeup available upon request 
<br>
##### Another project built over the course of a semester. In a small group, we used Natural Language Processing theories and tools such as BERT and LGBM Classifier to create and analyze a classification model based on text embeddings scraped from internet forums. Despite a small sample size and some tough to define data, we were able to increase our validation accuracy from 11% in a starter naive approach to 45% using logistic regression. Next, we discussed several external models such as XGBoost and KNN, but settled on LGBM Classifier. Utilizing this and fine tuning our model, we achieved 53% test accuracy. This was the end of the project, but it opened our eyes to more changes we could have made from the start, especially in gathering a larger sample and solidifying our classification criteria.

- ## Encrypted File Sharing
[Project Spec](https://fa22.cs161.org/proj2/) \- Github repo and design doc available upon request 
<br>
##### For a project for my cybersecurity class, which was very tough but very rewarding, I built a client to store confidential data in an insecure database without compromising security. I utilized public and private key cryptography, digital signatures, HMACs, password-based and hash-based key derivation, and more. Although writing the \>1000 lines of Golang was difficult, the design of this project was more so. I'm proud of this project due to its complexity both in conceptual understanding and implementation.

- ## Pacman AI/ML
[Project Spec](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp23/projects/) \- Github repos available upon request 
<br>
##### In order to learn the building blocks of modern-day artificial intelligence and machine learning, I utilized algorithms/tools such as A* search, logical inference, Q-learning, Hidden Markov Models, Bayes Networks, neural networks, and more to solve a variety of increasingly complex search problems. These projects were all completed in Python, with the Pacman world as a foundation to base the rules of my algorithms and processes on.
<br> 

- ## RookieDB
[Project Spec](https://cs186.gitbook.io/project) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### Over the course of a semester, I built nearly every aspect of a database management system in Java. I implemented B+ tree indices and supported various advancements that are essential to today's database systems. These included query optimization, recovery logging, and concurrency. I also learned SQL as I worked on the project so as to be able to properly use the software.
<br>

- ## Build Your Own World
[Project Spec](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/) \- Github repo available upon request \- [In-depth Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT7JsByTKUo&ab_channel=DhruvVaish)
<br>
#####  By far the most creative project I've done, where my partner and I established aesthetics and design of both the world and code, including underlying data structures and algorithms. We collaboratively built an interactive 2D video game with randomly generated worlds. I also added extra features beyond the base spec, such as audio, cheat codes, and more complicated gameplay mechanics.
<br>

- ## Hog and Scheme Contests
[Hog Leaderboard](https://hog-contest.cs61a.org/winners) \- [Scheme Submission (Abstract Snail)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp21/proj/scheme_gallery/#abstract-snail)
<br>
##### I placed second in a strategy contest for the hog dice game in a famously difficult, 1000+ person intro CS class. I achieved this using intense recursion and probability to predict what the rest of the game might look like, and basing my choices on that. Additionally, in the same class, I won first place in a graphics contest using the Scheme programming language to create an image.
<br>

- ## Personal Website
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ekandell.github.io)
<br>
##### My first foray into using Jekyll and markdown in addition to HTML and CSS to produce a functioning website where I can display my projects and accomplishments.
<br>

- ## NumC
[Project Spec](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/projects/proj4/) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### I created my own version of the Python library Numpy using C. I optimized code for significantly increased performance (up to 500x speedup) using SIMD, OpenMP, loop unrolling, and more efficient algorithms.
<br>

- ## Gitlet
[Project Spec](https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2) \- Github repo available upon request
<br>
##### Working with a partner, I created a version-control software in Java based on Git that replicates add, remove, checkout, reset, merge, etc. 
<br>

- ## Ultimate Frisbee Team Site
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/ultimate-team-site)
<br>
##### A site I built using web foundations - HTML, CSS, and javascript - to advertise my ultimate frisbee team. Although it was never published and needs to be updated with the new roster, it has good fundamentals in addition to some fun javascript additions.
<br>

- ## Flashcards
[Github Repo](https://github.com/ekandell/flashcards)
<br>
##### A very simple swift iOS app I built to replicate tangible flashcards.
<br>

- ## Spotify Stats Web App
In production!
